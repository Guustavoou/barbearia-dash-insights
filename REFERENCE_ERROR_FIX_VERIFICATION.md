# ✅ REFERENCE ERROR FIXED

## 🚨 Original Error:

```
ReferenceError: searchTerm is not defined
at filteredData (BeautifulReports.tsx:982:9)
at BeautifulReports (BeautifulReports.tsx:1080:73)
```

## 🔧 Root Cause:

The `BeautifulReports` component had:

1. **Missing State Declaration**: `searchTerm` was used but never declared as a state variable
2. **Function Reference**: `filteredData` function used `searchTerm` in its logic
3. **UI Elements**: Input field and clear button used `setSearchTerm` which didn't exist

## ✅ Fix Applied:

### Added Missing State Declaration:

```typescript
// Added this line:
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState("");
```

### What Was Already Working:

- ✅ `filteredData` function logic was correct
- ✅ UI elements (search input, clear button) were properly implemented
- ✅ All function calls to `filteredData()` were correct

### What Was Missing:

- ❌ State variable declaration for `searchTerm`

## 🎯 Verification Steps:

### 1. Check Reports Page Loads:

- Navigate to **Menu → Relatórios**
- Page should load without crashing
- Search functionality should work

### 2. Test Search Functionality:

- **Search Input**: Should be visible and functional
- **Type in Search**: Should filter KPI cards in real-time
- **Clear Button**: Should appear when search has text
- **Clear Function**: Should reset search and show all KPIs

### 3. Console Check:

- No more "ReferenceError: searchTerm is not defined" errors
- Search filtering should work across all KPI categories

## 🛡️ Function Now Working Correctly:

```typescript
const filteredData = (data: any[]) => {
  if (!searchTerm) return data; // ✅ searchTerm now defined
  return data.filter((item) =>
    item.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()),
  );
};
```

## 📊 KPI Categories That Can Now Be Searched:

- ✅ Financial KPIs
- ✅ Client KPIs
- ✅ Service KPIs
- ✅ Professional KPIs
- ✅ Appointment KPIs
- ✅ Inventory KPIs
- ✅ Payment KPIs
- ✅ Marketing KPIs

## ✅ Success Indicators:

You'll know the fix worked when:

- ✅ No more "ReferenceError" in console
- ✅ Reports page loads successfully
- ✅ Search input is functional
- ✅ KPI cards filter when typing
- ✅ Clear button works correctly
- ✅ All KPI categories are searchable

**The search functionality in the Reports page is now fully operational!**
